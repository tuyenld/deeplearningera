# UI Tests without UI Testing

This project accompanies the [Testing the UI without UI Testing in Swift](https://masilotti.com/testing-ui-without-ui-testing) blog post. 

It illustrates three examples:

1. Tapping a button
1. Pushing a view controller
1. Presenting a view controller

All without the UI Testing framework!
